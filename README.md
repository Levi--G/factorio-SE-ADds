# SE - AnimeDev's Additions

This is a mod I made for my own server, but feel free to use it in your own Space Exploration save.
If you have suggestions im open to them but can't promise to add it.

This mod adds:

## Plantable trees

- These trees are fully grown in the greenhouse, so no saplings that consume precious UPS on big saves.
- The trees placed are adjusted according to the planet/biome they can spawn in, so no more unfitting trees in the wrong biomes, fully compatible with SE/Alien Biomes
- I also added a "Decorative trees" recipe to allow you to choose what tree gets created, in case you care about a pretty base with certain tree colors
- The tree growing is made with a small item tree with relistic fertilizer recipe (NPK production with real processes, but compacted for minimum complexity)
- Trees can also be processed again to allow for small total wood gain (i tried my best to balance this) so you can reforest planets that lost all their trees without giving wood (for instance nuking a planet with true nukes)

Methods of planting:
- Placing single trees: will result in a tree fitting the biome or a random tree if the biome is originally not suited for any trees
- Forest in a capsule: a capsule that tries to plant trees in a small circle around 32m, these and next methods don't place random trees, so they can plant less if the biome can't sustain trees
- Rainforest in a capsule: capsule that plants trees in a 128m radius
- Marauder tree missle: a missle that damages and plants (very limited) trees in 32m radius
- TREE NUKE: for reforesting planets, radius 1.5km, will do no damage to entities, it can take a while to generate the trees, but almost no UPS will be consumed doing it (game can lag slightly upon impact, but then ups should stay stable while trees are actually generated)

## Weapons

I think the piledriver is unnessesary expensive, especially if you think about how little you actually need to do damage from space irl. So i made a few missles compatible with weapon delivery cannons:
- Marauder missle: small fast-firing and cheap missle, good on auto targetting
- Treeplanting Marauder: plants a few trees to assert dominance over your enemies
- Jericho missle: Large cluster missile with 100 homing payloads Tony Stark would be proud of

## Recipes

This mod also adds alternative recipes for iron ignots and copper ignots from plates. The recipes don't accept production modules to prevent cheating and it still is less efficient that making with pyroflux. They are just so you can put leftover plates from certain recipes back on the ignot belt/lines. For instance if you get rid of scrap you get ores, but unless you have pyroflux present you can't make ignots even at a bad rate thus needing sepparate lines or trains. This fixes that.

It also adds an alternative FOGBANK recipe to allow creating bigger true nukes earlier at a bigger cost.

## Storage Tanks mk2-4

Extra tanks with extra storage! (made for better train system comatibility)

## Thanks to

Bio Industries (by TheSAguy) for 2 images/assemblers i used (farm and cokery).
Space Explorateion (by Earendel) modified the piledriver recipe and scanner code for missles.
